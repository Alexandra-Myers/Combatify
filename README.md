**This mod is a port of Mojang's Combat Test 8c to modern versions of MC, with an aim to be as accurate as possible without compromising any usability for the user.**

**This mod completely overhauls the current combat system in favor of CTS, with customizability for servers and clients so that you can get the best experience possible.**

**As well, we aim for a great deal of mod support (as much as can be reasonably expected) to give plenty of options to the end user.**

5. Added "Auto-Attack" performed by holding left click
    - Auto attacks are 1 tick slower from optimal fast-hit timing
6. Added "Grace Period", grants leeway in attack timing by providing a window (80% - 100%) where the attack is queued
    - Attacks can no longer be triggered before 100% intentionally
    - Grace Period hits will be delayed until a tick slower than optimal fast-hit timing

7. Reintroduced upwards knockback when hitting players in the air

10. Critical Hit alterations
    - Players can now crit and sprint hit at the same time
    - Weapon enchantments are now included in the base damage when calculating crits and potion effects
11. If an entity's largest dimension for their hitbox (width or height) is less than the minimum hitbox size, it gets expanded by enough to turn the largest dimension into that size

12. Sweeping-Edge alterations
    - Sweep-attacks exist with sweeping enchantment only
    - Nerfed Sweeping-Edge enchantment to 25/33/37.5% percent (was 50/66/75%)

<div align="center">

### Projectiles

</div>

1. Projectiles don't trigger invulnerability ticks
2. Arrow uncertainty value decreased from 1.0 to 0.25
3. Added bow fatigue
    - Bow Fatigue increases the uncertainty over time starting once you hold it for over 3 seconds
    - This is shown via the item shaking more aggressively in the player's hand
4. Changed how the user's momentum is passed onto projectiles
    - Now ignores the vertical momentum of the player entirely

<div align="center">

### Hunger

</div>

1. Eating gets reset when you get hit
2. Natural healing is faster (every 2 seconds, was 8)
3. Starvation is faster (every 2 seconds, was 8)

4. Natural healing works down to 6 food points, previously 18
5. Natural healing now drains food points directly with a 50% chance to not consume a food point. Saturation is not used when healing damage, and is only relevant as a "pause" until food drains (as originally intended)
6. Saturation is no longer added by food; if current saturation is higher than the amount for the food, nothing happens, otherwise, your saturation is set to the amount for the food.

7. Liquid food (stews, honey, milk, potions) can now be consumed in 20 ticks
8. Healing potions heal 6 points per level, and harming potions harm 6 points per level (4 previously)
